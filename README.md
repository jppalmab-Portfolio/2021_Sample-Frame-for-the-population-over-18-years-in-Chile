# 2021_Sample-Frame-for-the-population-over-18-years-in-Chile
## [Python|Document scraping|Decrypting|Programming]

In this project, I developed a programming software solution in Python to transform 346 huge pdf documents to CSV and built a Sample Frame with information on 15 million Chilean. This solution was implemented using AWS, and it was the most crucial project for the company after the pandemic to ensure a trustworthy pool for the sampling process.

__The repository does not contain the code due the security reasons and the sensible of the information. However, I presented a sample of one of the pdf documents and the final result into a .csv file.__
