[Python | Document scraping | Decrypting | Programming]

Welcome to the "Sample Frame for the Population over 18 Years in Chile" repository! This project showcases the development of a programming software solution in Python, leveraging document scraping, decrypting, and programming techniques. The main objective was to transform 346 large PDF documents into CSV format and construct a comprehensive Sample Frame containing information on 15 million Chilean individuals. This project played a vital role in ensuring a reliable and trustworthy pool for the sampling process, becoming one of the most crucial projects for the company following the pandemic.

**Abstract:**

In this project, I have developed a robust software solution using Python and implemented it on AWS. The solution efficiently processes and converts 346 large PDF documents into CSV format. These documents contain vital information on the Chilean population over 18 years of age, serving as the foundation for constructing a Sample Frame. The Sample Frame, with details on approximately 15 million individuals, plays a crucial role in various data analysis and sampling processes.

## Repository Contents:

1. Sample Input: A representative sample PDF document showcasing the format and structure of the source data.
1. Final Output: An anonymized and simplified version of the Sample Frame represented in a CSV file.

## Privacy Statement:

Due to the sensitive nature of the information contained within the PDF documents and the fact that it is a private project, the repository does not include the complete source code.

## How to Explore:

1. Visit the repository to access the sample input PDF document and the final output CSV file.
1. Review the sample input PDF document to understand the structure and content of the source data.
1. Examine the final output CSV file to observe the anonymized representation of the Sample Frame.

This repository showcases the significant efforts undertaken to develop a secure and efficient programming solution for transforming large-scale PDF documents into a structured Sample Frame. By ensuring data privacy and confidentiality, this project provides a reliable foundation for various data analysis and sampling processes. Join us on this journey of data transformation and trust-building in the post-pandemic era.
